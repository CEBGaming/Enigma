# Enigma
You wake one one day in the apartment you have shared with your Dad for as long as you can remember to discover he is nowhere to be found. What happened to him? To make everything stranger you begin to encounter strange people with interesting powers. Who are they? and Why do they say they know your Dad?

Play through mini games and encounter new friends in your hunt for your Dad.

My final project for my Degree.

This is very much a WIP, I just need it published for my degree. It is now playable without instruction! Please do give it a go if you have time, I would love to know what you think :)

Due to requirements for this piece of work it is only playable with mouse, for the road sections you click the direction buttons in the bottom left.
